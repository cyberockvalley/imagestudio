            “Simone’s photos were amazing, and he was
            absolutely incredible every step of the way! He was a pleasure to
            work with. He was quick and responsive over email in the months
            before and after the wedding, and always made time for us. He has
            great energy and works hard, so he was able to capture thousands of
            photos at every moment along the way in the 8 hours we hired, with
            an assistant who was also totally wonderful and sweet. He made us
            feel very comfortable and special. He took beautiful, unique photos
            that caught all of our little magical moments of the wedding day,
            with an eye for excellent lighting and details. He delivered them
            promptly about 2 months after the wedding. We were brought to tears
            seeing them! Our whole family is still marveling at how beautiful
            the photos came out.”
